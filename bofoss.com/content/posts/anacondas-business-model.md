# Open-source Business Model at Anaconda

It's no secret that Anaconda operates on a freemium model (open-core) with tiered pricing, catering to individual users, academics, and enterprises. But what's the real magic behind it? How does it all come together?

Anaconda wasn't always called Anaconda. It originated as **Scaled Analytics**, a company founded by Travis Oliphant (also the creator of NumPy and SciPy) to make scientific computing in Python more accessible. As the company scaled, the name change to Anaconda reflected the extensive and comprehensive nature of the software distribution. The renaming refined the platform's positioning and broadened its appeal beyond scientific computing.

The development of core scientific Python libraries, which form the foundation of Anaconda's ecosystem, has a rich history intertwined with open-source contributions and, in some cases, early government support. While Bokeh's initial funding came from DARPA's XDATA program, other crucial packages like NumPy and SciPy emerged from the efforts of academic researchers and the open-source community. NumPy, which provides fundamental array operations, and SciPy, which offers a wide range of scientific computing tools, were built incrementally by dedicated individuals driven by the need for better data analysis tools in Python.

# First Principles

* **Data Scientists are NOT Software Engineers —** Anaconda's business model is built on the understanding that data scientists and analysts often lack the software engineering expertise required for complex environment setups and package management. The platform simplifies these processes, enabling users to focus on data analysis and modeling.
* **Need for an integrated platform for Data Science —** By offering an integrated platform that includes package management, environment management, and cloud-based notebooks, Anaconda streamlines the data science workflow.

# Anaconda's Open-Core Business Model

This model involves offering a core set of features and functionalities for free, typically as open-source software while providing proprietary extensions and services for paying customers.

How does Anaconda decide which features to open source and which to monetize? It all comes down to the use case. If a feature is broad and widely applicable, it goes open source. If it's specialized or enterprise-focused, it becomes a commercial offering.

While this model benefits from the massive user base that comes from free distribution, creating a network effect and driving adoption, it is also hard to maintain a competitive edge in both the open-source and commercial markets, which requires continuous innovation.

Here's how Anaconda's open-core model works in practice:

**Open Core (Free):** The core of Anaconda's offering is the free and open-source Anaconda Distribution. This includes the conda package and environment manager, a vast collection of popular data science libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.), and basic Jupyter Notebook support. This free distribution attracts a large community of individual users, academics, and even some businesses.

**Proprietary Extensions (Paid):** Anaconda offers several paid tiers (Starter, Business, Enterprise) that provide additional features and services not available in the free version. These paid offerings cater primarily to businesses and organizations with more demanding needs, such as:

* **Enhanced Security Features:** Enterprise-grade security controls, including role-based access control, secure authentication, and vulnerability scanning.
* **Custom Package Repositories:** The ability to manage and distribute private or proprietary packages within an organization.
* **Cloud-Based Collaboration:** Scalable cloud Jupyter notebooks with enhanced collaboration features, more storage, and greater computing power.
* **Dedicated Support:** Access to professional support teams for assistance with installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.
* **Tailored Deployments:** Custom on-premises installations to meet specific organizational needs.

# Revenue Streams

**Subscriptions:** Anaconda offers various subscription tiers (Free, Starter, Business, Enterprise) with increasing features and support. This is their primary revenue source.

**Enterprise Solutions:** They provide tailored solutions for large organizations, as listed below.

* **Tailored Deployments**: Custom on-premises installations to meet specific organizational needs.
* **Custom Package Repositories**: Allowing enterprises to manage and distribute proprietary packages securely.
* **Advanced Security Features**: Enhanced controls for compliance and vulnerability management.

# Pricing

## Enterprise Features
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*gfSgNaszmj8u7PPt)
Enterprise customers often have private packages (custom builds) that they need to distribute to data scientists in the company easily. Using conda as a distribution channel for these packages allows data scientists to access these packages as they would any other Python library (note that they do need to include the custom channel in their config — but this can be company-wide setting and applied broadly to all developer environments)

## Cloud Jupyter Notebooks
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*FBuTgnAWrIXS6y9v)
As users pay more, they get more computing, storage, etc, on cloud Jupyter notebooks. This allows for scalable computing power and storage, enhanced features for team collaboration on notebooks, and access to environments and tools without local installations.

## Deployment Features

Anaconda provides robust deployment capabilities that enable enterprises to move from development to production efficiently.

* **One-Click Deployment**: Allows data scientists to deploy machine learning models, notebooks, dashboards, and applications directly from the Anaconda interface with minimal effort
